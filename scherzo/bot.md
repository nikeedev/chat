# The bot: Scherzo

This code is made to develop the official bot for the official chatium server. The code for the bot itself will be developed from here, and therefore any updates to the bots should be after these standards to make it work in general.

Scherzo comes from the Italian word which means "joke" or "jest.", or musically as 'playful', 'joking' or 'jokeful'. This bot will be used for entertainment and other stuff that are not moderation.

To call Scherzo just run a `.command` e.g. `.cmds` to get list of all commands, or `.funfact`
